# Kinect-HTML Interactive Experience

## Overview

The Kinect-HTML Interactive Experience project combines Kinect technology with HTML to create an engaging and interactive user experience. This project uses a Kinect sensor to detect body movements and gestures, translating them into actions on an HTML webpage. Users can interact with the webpage by moving their bodies in front of the Kinect sensor, triggering various animations and visual effects.

## Features

### Kinect Sensor Integration

- Utilizes a Kinect sensor to detect body movements, joint positions, and gestures.
- Translates Kinect sensor data into actions on the HTML webpage, allowing users to control various elements.

### Control HTML Elements

- Control the position, size, and behavior of HTML elements using Kinect gestures.
- Enable a dynamic and responsive user experience, including moving, resizing, and hiding elements.

### HTML Webpage with Ripple Effect

- Displays an HTML webpage with a captivating ripple effect background.
- Enhances user experience with visual effects and a responsive background image that covers the entire viewport.

### Interactive Trash Images

- Multiple trash images are displayed on the webpage, representing interactive elements.
- Clicking on a trash image triggers dynamic animations, repositioning the image randomly within the viewport.

### Start Button

- A "Start" button is provided on the webpage to initiate interactions or reveal the trash images.
- Hovering over the button reveals it, and moving the mouse away hides it.
- The button can be clicked to start the interactive experience.

### Gesture Recognition

- Recognizes specific Kinect gestures, such as hand movements and waving.
- Maps these gestures to trigger different interactions and effects on the webpage.
