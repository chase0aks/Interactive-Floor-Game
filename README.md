# Kinect-HTML Interaction with Ripple Effect

## Overview

This project combines Kinect technology with HTML to create an interactive experience. The Kinect sensor is used to control an HTML webpage, and a jQuery ripple effect enhances the visual experience. By moving your body in front of the Kinect sensor, you can trigger various interactions on the webpage.

## Features

### Kinect Sensor Integration

- Utilizes a Kinect sensor to detect body movements and gestures.
- Translates Kinect sensor data into actions on the HTML webpage.

### HTML Webpage with Ripple Effect

- Displays an HTML webpage with a beautiful ripple effect background.
- Enhances user experience with visual effects.
- The background image is responsive, covering the entire viewport.

### Interactive Trash Images

- Multiple trash images are displayed on the webpage.
- Clicking on a trash image triggers a dynamic animation, repositioning the image randomly within the viewport.

### Start Button

- A "Start" button is provided on the webpage.
- Hovering over the button reveals it, and moving the mouse away hides it.
- The button can be clicked to initiate interactions or reveal the trash images.
